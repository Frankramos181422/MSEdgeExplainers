## Introduction

Delayed clipboard rendering is the ability to delay the generation of a particular payload until it is needed by the target applications. It is useful when source applications support several clipboard formats, some or all of which are time-consuming to render. Delayed clipboard rendering enables web authors to specifically mark delayed rendered payloads and avoid producing them if they’re not requested by target applications. Currently, delayed rendering is supported in Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

## Background

In web applications, the clipboard can be accessed via the Data Transfer and Asynchronous Clipboard APIs, which provide methods to read and write supported formats from and to the system clipboard. Data Transfer APIs can only be accessed via JS events that block the main thread. If the clipboard payload is huge, performance is affected. The Asynchronous Clipboard API solves this by allowing asynchronous copy/paste operations, thus not blocking the main thread. In this document we will focus on the Asynchronous Clipboard API.

Quoting from the [editor's draft](https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#clipboard-item-interface):
> A clipboard item is conceptually data that the user has expressed a desire to make shareable by invoking a "cut" or "copy" command. A clipboard item serves two purposes. First, it allows a website to read data copied by a user to the system clipboard. Second, it allows a website to write data to the system clipboard.

A clipboard item may have multiple representations described by a MIME type. A target application, usually in response to the user performing a paste operation, will read one or more representations from the clipboard. The source application typically does not know where the user intends to paste the content at the time of copy, so the author must produce several formats when writing to the clipboard to prepare for many possible target applications. The generation of all representations may take enough time that it is noticeable to the user and it is unlikely that the target application will need all produced representations.

The ability to delay the generation of clipboard data until it is needed is important for applications that support data types that are expensive to generate. Source applications would be able to indicate which representations they support for a clipboard item and wait until the target application attempts to access a particular representation before generating the data for it.

## Goal

Leverage the existing Async Clipboard API to allow websites exchange large data payloads and improve performance by only producing clipboard payload when it’s needed by target applications.

## Non-Goals

* Modify the Data Transfer API
* Replace the current functionality of the Async Clipboard API, as delayed clipboard rendering would be used at the discretion of web authors and only in the formats of their choosing.

## Proposed Solution

With this proposal, we will be adding a new argument to the ClipboardItem constructor which will take a map of a MIME type to a callback. Authors should still be able to produce some formats immediately, so they may define the usual map with a MIME type as the key and a Blob as the value for formats that they don’t want to be delayed rendered.

### Example 1: Map of MIME type to promise or callback in write()

```js
const format1 = 'text/html';
const format2 = 'image/png';
const format3 = 'web application/x-custom-format-clipboard-format';
const textInput = '<style>p {color:blue}</style><p>Hello World</p>';
const blobInput = new Blob([textInput], {type: format1});
const delayedCallbacksMap = {
  format2: function() {
              return Promise.resolve(generateExpensiveImageBlob(), {format2});
	   },
  format3: function() {
              return Promise.resolve(generateExpensiveCustomFormatBlob(), {format3});
	   }
};
const clipboardItemInput = new ClipboardItem({format1: blobInput}, delayedCallbacksMap);
navigator.clipboard.write([clipboardItemInput]);
```

An alternative to this is to use a new method, called addDelayedWriteCallback in the following example, that takes in a map of formats to callbacks.

### Example 2: Map of MIME type to callback in new method

```js
const format1 = 'image/png';
const format2 = 'text/html';
const delayedFunctionsMap = {
  format1: function() {
             return Promise.resolve(generateExpensiveImageBlob(), {format1});
           },
  format2: function() {
             return Promise.resolve(generateExpensiveHTMLBlob(), {format2});
           }
};
navigator.clipboard.addDelayedWriteCallback(delayedFunctionsMap);
const blobInput1 = new Blob([], {type: format1});
const blobInput2 = new Blob([], {type: format2});
const clipboardItemInput = new ClipboardItem({[format1]: blobInput1, [format2]: blobInput2,});
navigator.clipboard.write([clipboardItemInput]);
```

The disadvantage of the latter approach is that it adds overhead to the web author, as it is a new function for them to learn. However, as the clipboard item constructor remains the same, web authors that want to adopt delayed clipboard rendering in their existing web applications will just be able to move the generation of data to the callbacks map and pass it to addDelayedWriteCallback, without needing to change their existing clipboard item’s constructor.

If the web author doesn't provide a delayed rendering callback or data, then an error is thrown in the source application and the write operation fails.

## Privacy and Security Considerations

### Privacy

No considerable privacy concerns are expected, but we welcome community feedback.

### Security

This feature works with mandatory data types and custom formats, it does not change the sanitization (or lack thereof) of the clipboard's payload. Websites need to explicitly state which formats will be delayed rendered and provide functions to do so, legacy apps will not suffer any changes. A user gesture requirement (transient user activation) and existing async clipboard API security measures (focus document, permission prompts) will remain as they are.

## IDL changes

`clipboard_delayed_callback.idl` to store the callbacks to generate the async data.
```
callback ClipboardDelayedCallback = Promise<Blob>();
```
`clipboard_item.idl` added an additional constructor (if the first proposal ends up being chosen to prototype).
```
[
  SecureContext,
  Exposed=Window
] interface ClipboardItem {
  [RaisesException] constructor(record<DOMString, Promise<Blob>> items);
  [RaisesException] constructor(record<DOMString, Promise<Blob>> items, record<DOMString, ClipboardDelayedCallback> callbacks);
  readonly attribute FrozenArray<DOMString> types;

  [
    CallWith=ScriptState,
    RaisesException
  ] Promise<Blob> getType(DOMString type);
};
```

## Open Questions

* What should happen if the user attempts to paste the content in a target application, but they have already closed the tab where the async data is supposed to be produced? We’ve identified three alternatives to address this issue:
  * Generate the clipboard data, which would override the author’s decision of delaying it until needed by a target application but prevents loss of information.
  * Asking the user if they would like to preserve contents on the clipboard before the app closes, which would require adding an extra step to close the tab.
  *  Throwing the contents of the clipboard away, which is in line with avoiding the production of expensive payloads that won’t be needed by a target application.
* Are there target applications or operating systems that expect data to be immediately available when the user tries to paste the content of the clipboard? If so, what should happen with the generation of data?
* What should the result of `getType()` be? There are two main alternatives:
  * Generate the clipboard's payload. This would be consistent with the on-demand behavior of delayed clipboard rendering and with current behavior of `getType()`.
  * Return an empty blob. This would be a very strict interpretation of only producing clipboard data when a target application needs it via a paste command.
